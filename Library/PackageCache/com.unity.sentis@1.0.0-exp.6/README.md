# Unity Sentis

**Unity Sentis** is a lightweight cross-platform neural network inference library for Unity.

Sentis can run neural networks both on the GPU and the CPU. For details, refer to the [Sentis documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.sentis@1.0).

This package is available as an experimental package, so it is not ready for production use. The features and documentation in this package might change before it is verified for release.
